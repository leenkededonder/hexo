An illustration visualizing the scope of the RESHAPE project, to be added to the project publication.

[RESHAPE](https://www.reshape.network/) is a collaborative, bottom-up research process that proposes instruments for transition towards an alternative, fairer, and unified arts ecosystem across Europe and the Southern Mediterranean. 

RESHAPE involved 40 artists, activists and art workers (‘Reshapers’) from all over Europe and the southern Mediterranean, who were supported by 6 facilitators and 4 advisors as well as a group of 19 partner organisations.
