Visual experiment using a sunburst chart as a navigator within a project management environment. 
The sunburst chart visualizes the projects on three levels: the outer circle shows the projects themselves. The inner circles group the projects per theme and subtheme. 

The colors visualize the status of the project: On schedule, Behind Schedule, Warning.

The goal of this visual is to navigate through all projects, without losing the link to the bigger picture, to quickly identify which projects are behind schedule and to see the influence of the status of the individual projects on the (sub)theme status.
